HTP BMW Scoring Algorithm
By: Zach Perry

Scoring for parental/educational
Start with base score: X
Goal is to lower score (lower = better)
Anytime an unsafe action is performed, X + Y
where Y is:
	speeding
	traffic violations
	other unsafe driving actions (TBD)
	Update: X = X + Y

Anytime a safe ride is completed, points removed based on X - Z
where Z is:
	the length of the ride (distance in miles)
	considerations to be added for:
		time of day
		traffic conditions
		length of ride (time)

Scoring for social aspects
